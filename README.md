## 🌦️ Flutter Project Showcase | Weather Application

I built a real-time Weather Application using Flutter, Dart, REST APIs, and Provider to understand API integration and state management in a practical way.

🔹 Key features of the app:

  • Real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API
  
  • Provider for efficient and clean state management
  
  • Smooth animations to enhance user experience
  
  • Well-formatted date, time, and weather data using the intl package

📌 Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
